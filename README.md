# CryptoWall tooling / information
This repository contains scripts / snippets created during my analysis of CryptoWall throughout the years.

* cryptowall-post-decoder.py: allows you to decode the communication from infectees
* decompress-cryptolocker-clone-bundle.py: allows you to decompress the fileblob downloaded by the CryptoLocker clone CryptoWall samples
